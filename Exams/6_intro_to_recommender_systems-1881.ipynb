    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We exist in a technological era where there is far too much content (movies, news articles, shopping products, websites, etc.) for individual items to each receive our personal consideration. For example, consider that the average Google search returns well over 1 million results, yet when last did you look at the websites past the [first page](https://backlinko.com/google-ctr-stats)?  This fact is often illustrated by what is known as the \"long tail problem\" (represented in the figure above), where tracking user engagement with items in a large content repository sees a small number of these items receiving a disproportionate amount of attention, while the majority of items are unexplored. The truth is that a user simply doesn't know of each item which exists, nor has the time to inspect each item even if it were known. \n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the above challenge, a natural question for service providers becomes: \"how do I ensure that an individual is shown a manageable portion of the total content I have available, while also ensuring that this content is relevant to and desired by them?\" It turns out that this is actually an extremely valuable question, both economically and within society as a whole. Luckily for us, decades of hard work by very intelligent individuals has largely answered this question through a collection of algorithms and computing techniques known as recommender systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, a recommender system functions by predicting a user's rating or preference for an item. This allows a service provider to build up a catalog of items which it believes the user will want to examine - thereby increasing their engagement with the service and allowing a wider array of content to be considered.\n",
    "\n",

We will also learn how to create a simple implementation of the two dominant methods currently studied in relation to recommender systems, namely content-based filtering and collaborative-based filtering. \n",

    "### Terminology: Users, Items, and Ratings  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we need to do when speaking about recommender systems is to get some terminology straight. Within a recommender system, there are two primary sets of entities: the Users and the Items. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we'd expect, **an item is a thing which is consumed**. It can be watched, read, bought, clicked-on, or considered. Items are passive; meaning that their properties or nature does not change. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Users are individuals who interact with the items in a recommendation system**. Through their *actions*, **users create ratings for specific items within a recommendation system**. Ratings can be either *explicit* (such as giving your favorite movie 5/5 stars on review) or *implicit* (such as watching a movie; even though you haven't rated it directly, by viewing something you indicate that you have some interest in it). Within this train, we only consider explicit ratings, but many of the principles covered here will apply to implicit ratings as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A given user can have ratings for many items in the system, or none at all. Generally, as a user continues to interact with a recommender system, the more it will be able to capture her preferences and ratings for items. "

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having learnt about the entities which exist within recommender systems, we may wonder how they function. While this is something that we'll learn throughout this entire train, one fundamental principal that we need to understand is that recommender systems are built up by utilising the _relations_ which  exist between items and users. As such, these systems always need a mechanism to measure how related or _similar_ a user is to another user, or an item is to another item. \n",
    "\n",
    "We accomplish this measurement of similarity through, you guessed it, a similarity metric.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, a similarity metric can be thought of as being the inverse of a distance measure: if two things are considered to be very similar they should be assigned a high similarity value (close to 1), while dissimilar items should receive a low similarity value (close to zero). Other [important properties](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/1b/1b.2/1b.2.1) include:\n",
    " - (Symmetry) $Sim(A,B) = Sim(B,A)$ \n",
    " - (Identity) $Sim(A,A) = 1$\n",
    " - (Uniqueness) $Sim(A,B) = 1 \\leftrightarrow A = B$\n",
    " \n",
    "While there are many similarity metrics to choose from when building a recommender system (and more than one can certainly be used simultaneously), a popular choice is the **Cosine similarity**. We won't go into the fundamental trig here (we hope that you remember this from high school), but recall that the as an angle becomes smaller (approaching $0^o$) the value of its cosine increases. Conversely, as the angle increases the cosine value decreases. It turns out that this behavior makes the cosine of the angle between two p-dimensional vectors desirable as a [similarity metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) which can easily be computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the figure above to help guide our understanding, the Cosine similarity between two p-dimensional vectors ${A}$ and $B$ can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "Sim(A,B)  &= \\frac{A \\cdot B}{||A|| \\times ||B||} \\\\ \\\\\n",

    "\\end{align} $$ \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things a little more concrete, let's work out the cosine similarity using our provided example above. Here, each vector represents the ratings given by one of two *users*, $A$ and $B$, who have each rated two books (rating#1 $ \\rightarrow r_1$, and rating#2 $ \\rightarrow r_2$). To work out how similar these two users are based on their supplied ratings, we can use the Cosine similarity definition as follows:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\begin{align}\n",
    "Sim(A,B)  & = \\frac{(A_{r1} \\times B_{r1})+(A_{r2} \\times B_{r2})}{\\sqrt{A_{r1}^2 + A_{r2}^2} \\times \\sqrt{B_{r1}^2 + B_{r2}^2}} \\\\ \\\\\n",

    "## Assessing the Performance of a Recommender System\n",
    "\n",
    "One more thing we need to consider before we dive into the inner workings of recommender system algorithms is the aspect of how to evaluate their performance. After all, how can you tell if a recommendation is good if the item being suggested is something you've never seen before? \n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approach is to use a statistical method such as [A/B testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing), where two very similar users are shown different recommendations; with user A being shown randomly selected items from our catalog, and user B being shown recommendations generated by our algorithm. Unfortunately, like other areas of machine learning, this strategy may be a bit too risky/expensive to let a poor recommendation system (or random recommendations!) be exposed to users. Instead, in a similar approach to other machine learning fields, we tend to make use of historical rating data collected from users to test our systems. Here, as we have seen before, we partition our historical rating data into train and test splits; using train data to help build and tune our recommendation algorithms, while test data are withheld in order to perform assessment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this sense, there are two main variants of metrics which we use to evaluate the predictions made by a recommender system: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective performance measures for a recommendation system provide results which do not depend upon personal interpretation in order to assign success. These measures tend to focus around actual preference/ratings given by users to items, and are compared against ratings/preference predicted by an algorithm. Common examples of objective measures include: \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Single-value metrics:** These are quantities which we've seen before such as RMSE and MAE which measure the error between a known and predicted rating on a continuous scale. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "   - **Catalog-based metrics:** These are measures of performance computed over lists of recommended items generated for a user. They mainly consist of variations surrounding what is known as the *hit-rate*, which determines the number of highly-rated items appearing in a recommendation list which the user has actually given a high rating to.    \n",
    "   \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Coverage:** This metric is calculated across multiple user recommendation lists, and returns the number of users who received at least one high-rated recommendation in their list. \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Subjective Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "As a natural contrast to objective performance measures, subjective metrics provide quantitative values which must be interpreted in order to determine success. These measures typically capture characteristics of recommendations which are not directly related to rating data, but which nonetheless may be very important when a user decides whether or not to follow a suggestion. Two popular measures are:   \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Novelty:** This is a measure of how many under-rated items (not to be confused with poorly-rated ones) are suggested to a user. Exposing individuals to lesser-known items in a catalog is, as we have already discussed, vital to a recommender system's functioning. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Diversity:** This measurement evaluates the number of different item categories present in a recommendation list given to a user. \n",

    "In Content-based Filtering, we seek to make recommendations based on **how similar the properties or features of an item are to other items**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the image above to help us see how this works. Mpho is an avid reader who has just finished the novel \"The Golden Compass\". Besides the written contents inside this book (item), it has certain attributes or properties which further describe it - such as the author (\"Philip Pullman\"), genre (\"fantasy), or target audience (\"young adult\"). These properties are not unique to this novel, as other books also have authors, genres, target audiences, etc. As such, we can compare the properties of different books with the assumption that books which have properties in common (such as author or genre) are similar to one another. We can further **assume that individuals like similar items**. For our example, this means that Mpho, if using content-based filtering to recommend her next book, would have a book such as \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\" suggested to her over Anne Frank's \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", as the former novel is far more 'similar' to The Golden Compass.     \n",

    "Let's implement a simple content filtering-based recommendation algorithm.\n",

Following along from our example above, we're going to use the `tag_name` field for each book as a representation of properties such as genre, time-period, and target audience. We're also going to consider the `authors` field, as individuals often enjoy reading novels written by the same author. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start off by creating a new column in our `books` dataframe called `auth_tags`, which contains the above-motivated contents for each item. We additionally create two pandas series objects to help us translate between book titles and indexes of our dataframe.  "

For example,  other works by Tolkien and Shakespeare are highly recommended when using reference searches for \"The Hobbit\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\" respectively. This could be a natural result of the fact that an author's name is far less common in the dataset than other textual features such as genre. As such, books which share an author will be regarded as being far more similar.  \n",

    "Based on these observations, we can ask if in fact the recommendations for \"The Hobbit\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\" are actually any good? After all, a reader who knows of Tolkien and Shakespeare will often already know of other books these authors have written as well. This is where some of the subjective metrics introduced earlier (such as diversity), can be used to penalize these recommendations and help discover better ones. \n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Explore-AI/Pictures/master/Utility_Matrix.jpg\"\n",
    "     alt=\"Collaborative-based Filtering - Utility Matrix\"\n",
    "     style=\"float: center; padding-bottom=0.5em\"\n",
    "     width=700px/>\n",
    "Utility matrix used to assess the similarity between users who have rated items. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In content-based filtering, we looked at the similarity between the properties or attributes of items. In Collaborative-based filtering, we **use the similarity measured between users to make recommendations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this works, consider several individuals who are currently using our collaborative-based recommender system. Simon, Kwanda, Kieran and Joanne have all rated certain books that they've read, and we've been able to capture these results. Using this information, we can construct what is known as a **Utility Matrix**, which (as shown in the figure above) is a structure simply capturing our rating data in a formal way. In the utility matrix, each user is represented as a row$^*$, and the items (books) in our catalog make up features for each user - whether they have rated a book or not, and what ratings they have given. We note here importantly that this matrix is inherently *sparse*, as there are far more items available in the catalog than a user's supplied ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the structured information in the utility matrix, we can measure how similar users are to one another based on their rating characteristics. Using our example to help make this point, consider how Joanne and Simon could be considered to be similar as both have read the novels \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", and have given very similar ratings for both. On the other hand, even though Kwanda has also read and similarly rated \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", he would still be considered less similar to a user like Simon as they have fewer book reviews in common. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this principle of user similarity, when we seek to make a recommendation for a user based on collaborative filtering, we usually seek to determine the *k-neighbors* who are most similar to the user. From these users, we then extract their highly-rated items and use these as a basis for recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "One powerful argument of why using user similarity is favorable, compared to that of item similarity, lies in recommendation variety. When looking at our content-based recommendations, we observed that the items suggested tended to be homogeneous; they were all by the same author or genre etc. But humans aren't homogeneous all the time - we like different things in different categories and at different times. As collaborative filtering considers similar individuals, it also considers similarities across categories, allowing recommendations to be more varied and natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major downside to this approach, however, is described by what is known as **'Cold-start problem'**. Consider for example user Kieran who has just recently joined our recommender service. He has supplied only one rating; he seems to absolutely love \"The Hunger Games\". The problem is that no one else in our service has rated that book, and Kieran hasn't rated anything else as well. This predicament means that we cannot get a similarity between Kieran or any other user - making our collaborative approach infeasible! While there are various ways of getting around this problem (we see a simple example in our implementation), the Cold-start problem is an ongoing challenge which continues to haunt recommender system researchers. If you feel passionate about this field, perhaps you need to be the person to go and solve this problem definitively once and for all!\n",
    "\n",
    "$^*$*Note that this isn't always the case, as its perfectly acceptable for the utility matrix to have rows representing items and columns representing users. The important thing is that we are mapping ratings from users to items in one form or another.*  "

    "Just as we did in the content-based approach, we can generate user-item ratings for collaborative filtering. We do this by using the following algorithmic steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Select a reference user from the database and a reference item (book) they have _not_ rated. \n",
    "   2. For the reference user, gather the similarity values between them and each other user. \n",
    "   3. Sort the gathered similarity values in descending order. \n",
    "   4. Select the $k$ highest similarity values which are above a given threshold value, creating a collection $K$ similar users. \n",
    "   5. For each user in collection $K$, get their rating of the reference item if it exists (other users may not have rated this item as well)\n",
    "   6. Compute a weighted average rating from both the gathered rating values and user similarity values. This is expressed in formula as: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$ \\hat{R}_{ju} = \\frac{\\sum_{n \\in K} s_{nu} \\times r_{nj}}{\\sum_{u \\in K} s_{nu}}   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Where $\\hat{R}_{ju}$ is the weighted average computed for the reference item $j$ and reference user $u$, $K$ is the collection of similar users, $s_{nu}$ is the similarity computed between users $n$ and $u$, and $r_{nj}$ is the know rating user $n$ has given item $j$.\n",

    "## Comparing Collaborative and Content-based Filtering \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Having now considered both content and collaborative-based filtering, we can spend a little time comparing the operation and results of these two methods for recommendation. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Metric Comparison: Student Exercise \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the above sections we implemented functions for predicting item (book) ratings using both collaborative and content filtering. Using an appropriate performance metric such as RMSE or MAE, determine which of these two methods is more appropriate for the GoodBooks dataset. You could do this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Divide the `book_ratings` dataframe into a train and test subset using random sampling. Ensure that the train set is 90 - 95% of the total data.  \n",
    "   2. Computing similarity matrices using the data available in the train set (this will mainly affect collaborative filtering)\n",
    "   3. For each user-item rating in the test set, generate a rating prediction. \n",
    "   4. Use the historical rating data in the test set to quantify the performance of each technique. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've computed these results, consider how you could improve either method to be more competitive. How feasible are these changes? \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Considerations \n",
    "\n",
    "A couple more things to take into account when implementing these methods:\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Diversity of Suggestions**: As has already been observed within this train, the diversity of recommendations offered by a recommender algorithm are important. In this sense, collaborative filtering is often considered to produce superior results over content-based filtering.  \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Computational requirements**: While we've used simple examples to illustrate the implementation of collaborative and content-based filtering, you should not overlook considerations for the type of computational resources these methods rely upon. In this sense, both methods require the computation of similarity structures when making recommendations. For content-based filtering, this similarity structure tends to be smaller compared to its collaborative counter-part, as large recommendation services tend to have far more users than items in their databases. The storage of these similarity matrices can take up considerable space. Furthermore, the properties of items remain quite static; meaning that once the item similarity matrix is computed it can be reused indefinitely (until more properties are used for similarity computation). On the other hand, as user ratings are added to at a constant rate, the utility matrix and subsequently user similarity matrix need to be updated regularly to ensure appropriate recommendations are produced.         \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    " - **Sparsity Issues**: We've briefly mentioned the Cold-start problem before within this train. To reiterate the point, due to the sparse nature of the utility matrix, it can often become very difficult to make recommendations for users who have few or no ratings captured. However as time increases, systems which make use of collaborative filtering techniques get progressively better as they passively acquire richer rating data.    \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " - **Hybrid Approaches**: In light of the points raised above, one may wonder if there is a 'best of both worlds' approach for recommendation systems which overcomes the limitations of each method. The short is that there is, and this consists of hybrid content-collaborative filtering systems. These are a hot research topic at the moment, with all major tech companies such as Google, Netflix, Facebook, and Amazon refining such hybrid approaches.  "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Phew! We've covered a lot of ground in just one train. Hopefully at this point the ideas behind recommender systems and why they are so economically and socially important are a bit less mystical to us. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this train we looked at the building blocks of recommender systems; items (things) and users (people). We've learnt how recommender algorithms fundamentally use similarity as a mechanism to compare these items and users, with item-item similarity being represented by content-based filtering methods, and user-user similarity being an integral part of collaborative filtering methods. We've reviewed each these methods both theoretically and practically through code implementation. Lastly, we've used the results obtained in our implementation step to discuss some trade-offs offered between content and collaborative filtering. \n",
